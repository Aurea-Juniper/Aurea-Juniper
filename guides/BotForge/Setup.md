## Requirements
I agree, it's a pain for the first timers. But yeah it's actually really, really simple. So just follow my steps carefully and keep in mind:
- Be patient, it can be really frustrating at times
- Always try to reason, ask questions, and try to answer them yourself.
- Try to get out of your little comfort zone
## Setups
Let's get the show on road, you know I'm a bit chatty type, so I'll break down stuff to you, so you can **learn**. Chose the one you use. Sorry but I don't bother making you a guide on how to know what your using.
### Pterodactyl setup
So for pterodactyl panel users, it's hate to break it to you, but it's kinda pain. But let's get started, I'll try to keep it simple. By the way it's painful, not difficult!
